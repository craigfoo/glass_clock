The code is made up of libraries from Adafruit to control NeoPixels and Amazon Alexa Gadget samples to talk with a timer set on the Echo.

NeoPixels, https://www.adafruit.com/product/1460
Amazon Alexa Gadget repo, https://github.com/alexa/Alexa-Gadgets-Raspberry-Pi-Samples

I followed Adafruit's instructions to get NeoPixels to work on a RaspberryPi, https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide

The Alexa Gadget guide is fairly easy to follow. Make sure you enter your IDs in the 'Glass_Clock.ini file.
